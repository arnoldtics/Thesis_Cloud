            <p>
                The gender classification was performed using authors' first names with Meta's deep learning model 
                Bart-Large (trained on the MultiNLI dataset for Zero-Shot Classification). The model assigned 
                probabilities between two categories: "man" and "woman". Only classifications with probability 
                scores higher than 65% were considered confident assignments; otherwise, theses were categorized 
                as "unsure". This analysis aims solely to visualize historical participation trends across genders 
                in academic production at the university.
            </p>
            <p>
                We recognize gender is a spectrum and that name-based classification has limitations. These 
                visualizations should be interpreted as approximate trends rather than definitive categorizations.
